# Siphamandla Mazibuko — Software Engineering Portfolio

I am a junior software engineer based in Pretoria, South Africa, with a strong
interest in system design, backend development, and building tools that are
explicit, predictable, and easy to reason about.

I value correctness, clarity, and deliberate trade-offs over cleverness.
My work tends to focus on backend systems, domain-specific tooling,
and applications with real operational constraints.



## Flagship Project

### Memo — Typed DSL for Explicit Data Operations

**Memo** is a small, strongly-typed domain-specific language designed to make
CRUD operations explicit, validated, and predictable.

Instead of implicit data access logic scattered across application code,
Memo enforces intent through grammar, validation, and compilation.

**Key aspects:**
- Custom language grammar built with Lark
- AST-based validation layer enforcing semantic rules
- Compilation into executable query plans
- Deterministic in-memory execution engine
- Strict static typing with isolated dynamic boundaries
- Full test coverage for core language semantics

**Why it matters:**  
Memo demonstrates my approach to system design: explicit contracts,
clear invariants, and layered architecture that is hard to misuse.

**Tech:** Python, Lark, PyLance (strict), PyTest

## Collaborative & Hackathon Projects

### Nexus — Collaboration & Learning Platform  
*Kion Consulting Hackathon 2025 — Team Project*  
**Role:** Backend API & Integration Contributor

A collaboration and learning platform supporting courses, meetings, tasks,
notifications, and authentication, built with a React frontend and a polyglot
backend (TypeScript Node + Python Flask).

**My contributions included:**
- Backend API development and endpoint integration
- API testing and TypeScript error resolution
- Linking backend services to the frontend client
- Coordinating and merging pull requests across branches
- Improving configuration and repository hygiene

**Tech:** TypeScript, Node.js, Express, React, Flask

### UbuntuAI — Autonomous Bot Development  
*EPSza Hackathon 2025 — Team Project*  
**Role:** Primary Bot Author & Maintainer

UbuntuAI is an autonomous Java-based bot developed for a competitive simulation
environment, focused on movement strategies, targeting logic, and adaptive behavior.

**My contributions included:**
- Implemented the initial UbuntuAI bot and configuration
- Designed and iterated on movement and combat strategies (corner strategy, operate modes)
- Refactored bot logic to improve behavior clarity and extensibility
- Added targeting sweeps, enemy counting, and conditional decision logic
- Updated metadata and runtime configuration (Java 21 compatibility)
- Performed repository cleanup by removing extraneous sample bots and files
- Authored and merged a pull request integrating development work into main

This work demonstrates **algorithmic thinking, iterative refinement, and disciplined
refactoring within an existing codebase**, as well as responsible repository maintenance.

**Tech:** Java, JSON configuration, shell scripting


### MoMe Travel Risk Monitor  
*Monkey & River Hackathon 2025 — Team Project*  
**Role:** Backend & Infrastructure Contributor

A real-time travel risk monitoring system designed to surface weather-related
hazards (hail, flooding, high winds) along active routes, with route-aware
alerts and risk scoring.

**My contributions included:**
- Backend API endpoints for routes, alerts, vehicles, and users
- Authentication middleware fixes and registration flow improvements
- Supabase setup with typed data models and seed data
- Infrastructure cleanup and repository hygiene
- Removal of legacy server components

**Tech:** Node.js, Express, Supabase, PostgreSQL



### Monitoring & Analysis System  
*Monkey & River Hackathon 2025 — Team Project*  
**Role:** Full-Stack Contributor

A monitoring and analysis platform for alerts, diagnostics, and monitored
locations, including authentication and AI-assisted analysis features.

**My contributions included:**
- Project setup and configuration
- React + Vite frontend development with responsive theming
- Authentication integration and fixes
- User and profile modules
- Alert, analysis, and AI summary features
- Data model updates and mock data setup

**Tech:** React, Vite, Tailwind, Node.js, Express



### Digital Mafia App  
*Monkey & River Hackathon 2024 — Team Project*  
**Role:** Project Setup & Frontend Contributor

A role-based onboarding and administration platform featuring OTP/email
verification, admin approval workflows, and operational dashboards.

**My contributions included:**
- Initial project scaffolding and setup
- Frontend structure and layout groundwork
- Project documentation and README improvements

**Tech:** Angular, Angular Universal (SSR), Express, JWT



## Cross-Project Themes

Across my projects, I consistently focus on:
- Designing and implementing backend APIs with clear contracts and invariants
- Authentication and authorization flows in multi-user systems
- Data modeling, persistence, and infrastructure setup
- Type safety, validation, and correctness at system boundaries
- Iterative refinement and refactoring of existing codebases
- Coordinating work across teams, branches, and pull requests
- Balancing rapid delivery with maintainable architecture in constrained environments



## Skills

- Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Java
- Backend development (Node.js, Express)
- API design (REST)
- Authentication & authorization patterns
- Data modeling and persistence (SQL, Supabase/PostgreSQL)
- Static typing and validation (PyLance, TypeScript)
- Language & compiler design fundamentals
- Algorithmic problem-solving and behavioral logic
- Git & collaborative workflows
