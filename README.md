# Siphamandla Mazibuko — Software Engineering Portfolio

I am a junior software engineer based in Pretoria, South Africa, with a strong
interest in system design, backend development, and building tools that are
explicit, predictable, and easy to reason about.

I value correctness, clarity, and deliberate trade-offs over cleverness.
My work tends to focus on backend systems, domain-specific tooling,
and applications with real operational constraints.



## Flagship Project

### Memo — Typed DSL for Explicit Data Operations

**Memo** is a small, strongly-typed domain-specific language designed to make
CRUD operations explicit, validated, and predictable.

Instead of implicit data access logic scattered across application code,
Memo enforces intent through grammar, validation, and compilation.

**Key aspects:**
- Custom language grammar built with Lark
- AST-based validation layer enforcing semantic rules
- Compilation into executable query plans
- Deterministic in-memory execution engine
- Strict static typing with isolated dynamic boundaries
- Full test coverage for core language semantics

**Why it matters:**  
Memo demonstrates my approach to system design: explicit contracts,
clear invariants, and layered architecture that is hard to misuse.

**Tech:** Python, Lark, PyLance (strict), PyTest
